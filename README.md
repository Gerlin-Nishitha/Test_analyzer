# Test_analyzer
I developed an AI-powered Text Analysis Chatbot that allows users to upload text files or manually input content for real-time text analysis. The chatbot provides insights like word count and enables users to download the analysis as a file. Built using Hugging Face for NLP and Gradio for an interactive UI, this project simplifies text processing and analysis. ðŸš€
